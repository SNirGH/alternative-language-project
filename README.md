# Alternate Language Project

### What programming language and version did you pick?
I picked the Rust programming language, version 1.75.

### Why did you pick this programming language? 
I tried using it in the past for one of my assignments but never really dove to deep into it.\
I wanted to explore the language more and see why many people enjoy the language.

### How you r programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling.
#### Object-Oriented Programming:
Rust does not have inheritance and has zero-cost abstraction. It also does not have the keyword "class". Instead everything is a struct, enum, or trait. 
#### Assignment statements: 
Rust has the "let" keyword. By default, all variables are immutable. To make a variable mutable, you must use the "mut" key word near "let".
